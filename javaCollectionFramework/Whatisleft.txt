try to create a user defined data type and use that for set 
like students{
    int rollno;
    String Name;
}

also try to sort students 
done by using implementing comparable in the student class

comparable can only compare one class at once

hence comparator can be used to do this

also lambda fucntion can also be used at the same time!
